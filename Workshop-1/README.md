# Connect Four (9x12 Grid)

A simple browser-based **two-player Connect Four** game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Players take turns placing tiles on a 9x12 grid until one player connects four in a row or the game ends in a draw.  

This version includes a **custom alert popup** instead of the default browser alert, giving the game a cleaner and more modern look.
